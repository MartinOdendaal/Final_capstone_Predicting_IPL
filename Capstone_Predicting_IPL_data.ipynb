    "\n",
    "Sports betting is a billion-dollar industry. Cricket betting, albeit small compared to football or baseball, was still valued at USD10 billion annually with a further USD40 to USD50 billion in [illegal bets](http://www.espncricinfo.com/pakistan/content/story/535250.html) (often from India and Pakistan where betting is banned). Models that can consistently predict outcomes and beat the odds of bookmakers can therefore have great value.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to predict the outcome of Indian Premier League (IPL) matches. The IPL, a professional Twenty20 cricket league in India, is the richest tournament in cricket. It is contested annually in April and May. While the teams represent Indian cities (and in some cases a state), it attracts the best players from around the (cricket-playing) world.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules of cricket can seem quite involved, this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqtpNkMvj5Y) provides a 5 minute introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "The bulk of the data is available from a Kaggle [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/manasgarg/ipl/data) which includes ball-by-ball information for each of the games between 2008 - 2017 (636 games in total) as well as a separate database with match level information. "

    "## Notebook 1: Summary\n",
    "This notebook processes the data so that it can be inspected and visualized (Notebook 2) and modelled (Notebook 3). \n",
    "The original data consists of two datasets. The first – imported here as ‘IPL’ – contains ball-by-ball information of each game. For each ball it contains information on the batsman, the bowler, their respective team, and various measure based on the outcome of the (bowled) ball. The second dataset – imported as ‘matches’ contains game level information: the city, the venue, the teams and the outcome.\n",
    "The structure (and the broad aims) of the notebook is as follows: <br>\n",
    "1.\t**Clean up the datasets:** This section ensure common spelling of team names, deals with some missing data, adapts some data to make it easier to use, and removes matches that were tied (or abandoned). The most important decision here is the removal of the entire 2009 season which was played in South Africa due to terrorist threats in India. While this makes an already small dataset even smaller, it is necessary as the conditions were not similar. <br>\n",
    "2.\t**Create a home team feature:** Home team advantage is a well-established part of sport. However, in the case of IPL it is somewhat complicated by the fluctuation of teams of years, the occasional sharing of home grounds, and some matches played in Dubai. This feature is ultimately more noise that hoped for, but is still likely to be valuable in the model.\n",
    "3.\t**Create intermediate features:** Create team IDs <br>\n",
    "4.\t**Summarize runs and wickets in a particular game:** This summarizes the ball by ball (IPL) dataset into the high level (matches) dataset for visualization in Notebook 2.<br>\n",
    "5.\t**Squad statistics:** The bulk of the processing of the data is to create team summary statistics based on individual information from the IPL set. Two new datasets (one for batting and one for bowling) are created containing the batting and bowling performance statistics of each player for a given season. These stats are then aggregated into team statistics which are then used as features. Note that this process is leaky: it includes information from games for the entire season. \n",
