# Final_capstone_Predicting_IPL
This project was submitted as the final capstone of the Thinkful bootcamp. The project attempts to outperform betting odds in predicting the outcome of IPL cricket matches.

This repository contains 3 notebooks. Notebook 1 (Capstone_Predicting_IPL_data) performs some data processing, Notebook 2 (Capstone_Predicting_IPL_stats) is used for descriptive stats and visualization, and Notebook 3 (Capstone_Predicting_IPL_models) contains all the modeling results.

Each notebook contains a summary; Notebook 3 also provides a more general project overview and conclusion.
